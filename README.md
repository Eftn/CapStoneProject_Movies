# CapStoneProject_Movies
CapStone Project created to list movie details
1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
The goal would be for the user to type in a movie title and to then see data regarding that movie such as actors, date of release etc.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
The users can range from millennials to generation x. 

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
I plan to use a movie API that will indicate details regarding the movie that is selected.

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

a. What does your database schema look like?
My database schema will have a id, movie title, release date, actors, awards , nominations and rating.

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
Depending on the API it may not have all the information that I previously mentioned or it may not be compatible with the coding that I'm using, if so I will have to make room to change , correct or improvise.

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
No there aren't any information that needs to be secured.

d. What functionality will your app include?
A simple search bar , when the user enters in the data, the page should load to the API movie selected and list the data available for that movie. 

e. What will the user flow look like?
A simple search bar, navigation back to home.

f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
I do not have any additional goals other than showing data about the movie.
